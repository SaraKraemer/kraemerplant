				A care guide for pothos plants is almost redunant, as they are incredibly
				easy to keep alive. (In fact, they are often referred to as "devil's ivy
				because they are so hard to kill! They need only sparse waterings and these
				plants will thrive in almost any setting.

			Pothos plants don't actually have to be planted in soil; they do very well
			just placed in a container with water. If you do decide to plant them in
			soil, any potting mix is fine.

			Pothos do well in a wide variety of light conditions and are therefore an
			excellent option for even low-light homes - in fact, it is best to avoid
			direct sunlight. A variegated pothos placed in low-light conditions may lose
			some of its white color because only the green part of the leaf can absorb
			light. On the other hand, if you notice that your pothos' leaves look paler
			than usual, that's a sign that your plant is getting too much light.

			Propagating pothos is extremely easy. You can simply remove a leaf and node
			and place in soil or water to root. Be mindful however that cuttings started
			in one growing medium have a hard time switching to the other.

		<div class="txtboxw">
			While pothos plants are an easy to care for houseplant, you do need to be
			aware that they are poisonous. Though rarely fatal, the plant can cause
			irritation and vomiting if ingested due to the fact that it contains calcium
			oxalates. It is considered toxic to cats, dogs and children.

			Naturally, pothos plants are trailers. As trailers, they are great as indoor
			hanging plants or placed up high on shelves. Pinching back stems at the tips
			ensures that your plant doesn't become too thin and stringy.
