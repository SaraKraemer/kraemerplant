				Sansevieria Trifasciata, also know as viper's bow string or "snake plant,"
				is one of the most hardy, tolerant plants. They are extremely low
				maintenance and can also act as air purifiers to improve your home's air
				quality.

				Snake plants do best with a free-draining soil mix because they are prone
				to root rot. Be sure to use a pot that won't trap water inside and promptly
				remove any standing water from the saucer.

				Place your snake plants in indirect light, although they are tolerant of a
				variety of light conditions. Snake plants do well when you almost forget
				about them. Allow soil to dry between waterings and take extra care not to
				over water in winter.

				Snake plants produce rhyzomes that are easily divided. This is best done in
				the spring, as propogated plants will grow faster in the summer. You can
				also propagate snake plants through leaf cuttings. Just cut 2 to 3-inch
				pieces of a leaf and place them about 1 inch deep in soil.

				When shopping for snake plants, select one that has dark green leaves;
				leaves that are too pale indicate that the plant may already be
				faltering. They can grow anywhere from 8 inches to 12 feet high.

				When repotting, choose a terra cotta or porous material pot and a potting
				mix that allows for good drainage. A little general purpose fertilizer can
				be used if the plants are in a pot, and that's about it!
